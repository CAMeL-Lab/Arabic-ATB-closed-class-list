# A Modern Standard Arabic Closed-Class Word List

This repository contains a list of Modern Standard Arabic closed-class words, 
which can be used as a stop list for a variety of natural language processing 
applications. The list contains 740 inflected words and clitics in the Arabic 
Treebank (ATB) tokenization scheme (Maamouri et al., 2004; Habash, 2010). 
The inflected words are based on 309 lemmas from the Standard Arabic Morphological 
Analyzer, SAMA (Graff et al., 2009).
